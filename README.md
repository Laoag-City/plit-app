## PLIT-APP

The Permit and License Inspectorate Team App (PLIT-App) aids the said team in keeping track of business records in the pre-registration stage of Business Permit Registration. Developed using Laravel, Livewire, Alpine.js, Tailwind CSS, and Leaflet.js.

**Features:**

1.  Inspection Checklist - A checklist of all requirements a business must comply to be registered. Each requirement belongs to an office imposing it. A requirement can be marked as complied by a user account associated with the office the requirement belongs in.
2. Business Permit QR Code scanner - A feature in Inspection Checklist so that instead of manually typing in a Business Identification Number, a user can easily input a business' Business Identification Number through a QR code in a Business Permit.
3. Tag Business Location - A feature in Edit Business Info that enables a user to pin the coordinates of the location of a business in an interactive map. Powered by Leaflet.js.
4. Business Image Uploads - Uploads images of a business establishment for documentation and additional information purposes.
5. Business pre-registration status checking - Keeps track of a business' pre-registration status depending upon the progress of its Inspection checklist. It also annually updates all businesses to renewal statusâ€”the period when every permit expires.
6. Bulk Excel import of all business record to populate the database.
